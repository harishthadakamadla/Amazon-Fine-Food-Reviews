# Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews
The Amazon Fine Foods Reviews  data set is about users giving reviews and scores for the products which they have purchased. 
The main objective of this assignment is to preprocess the data so that Machine Learning algorithms can be applied on them. 
Since we are dealing with Text data, we have to perform Lemmatization, Stemming and stopword removal.
Each user has a unique ID. In this project, the raw data set is taken and preprocessing has been done.
Using some domain knowledge, the data has been modified and enhanced.  
We apply Vectorization techniques like Bag of Word vectorization, TF-IDF, Average Word to Vector and Tfidf Weighted Word to Vector on the data. 
Using T-SNE, and U-Map, retain top 2 features and visualize it and check if the data seperates well enough of not.
